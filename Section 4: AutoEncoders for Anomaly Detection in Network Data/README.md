# Section 4: AutoEncoders for Anomaly Detection in Network Data

This section includes a 10 minute video lecture from Washington University in St.Louis Applications of Deep Neural Networks (T81-558) 
ccourse. The video is available on youtube and the link to the video is https://youtu.be/1ySn6h2A68I and the code for this video is @ 
https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/blob/master/t81_558_class_14_03_anomaly.ipynb.

To finisnd this section, listen to the video lecture and then go through or implement the code in the notebook for which the link is above.

Happy learning!!!!!
