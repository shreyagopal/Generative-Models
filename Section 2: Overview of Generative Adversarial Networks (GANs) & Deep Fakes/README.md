# Section 2: Overview of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Deep Fakes

This section includes a 8 minute video lecture from Washington University in St.Louis Applications of Deep Neural Networks 
(T81-558) ccourse. The video is available on youtube and the link to the video is https://youtu.be/0QnCH6tlZgc and the code for this video is @ https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/blob/master/t81_558_class_07_1_gan_intro.ipynb. 

To finisnd this section, listen to the video lecture and the can go throught the code of the lecture for which the links are above.

Happy learning!!!!!
