# Section 3: GANs in Keras

This section includes three parts taken from Washington University in St.Louis Applications of Deep Neural Networks (T81-558) ccourse.
The parts to complete this section are detailed below:

* **Part 1:** Implementing a GAN in Keras on Google Colab <br>
The resources for this task are a notebook, https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/blob/master/t81_558_class_07_2_Keras_gan.ipynb
and a video available @ https://youtu.be/T-MCludVNn4.

* **Part 2:** Face generation with StyleGAN <br>
The resources for this task are a notebook, https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/blob/44d4f09438ae4efc0ac2715b13ba5a135781c751/t81_558_class_07_3_style_gan.ipynb
and a video for the code is available @ https://youtu.be/Wwwyr7cOBlU.

* **Part 3:** GANs for semi-supervised learning <br>
This part includes a 11 minute video lecture available @ https://youtu.be/ZPewmEu7644 and the code for this video is https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/blob/master/t81_558_class_07_4_gan_semi_supervised.ipynb.

Happy learning!!!!!
