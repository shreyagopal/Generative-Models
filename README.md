# Generative-Models

## Agenda:

In this module, we will learn about Generative Models and deep learning approaches to generative modeling. These models have proven to be very useful in cybersecurity problems such as anomaly detection. Furthermore, deep learning techniques such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be used by adversaries to create Deep Fakes for social engineering attacks. Also, GANs can be used to generate manipulated input vectors to fool machine learning models for malware and intrusion detection. We will cover the adversarial use of GANs in the coming modules.

### The learning components of this module are:

* An introductory lecture from MIT's deep learning bootcamp, covering the fundamentals of generative models and deep learning approaches to generative modeling,
* 4 video tutorials (w. code) on training GANs in Tensorflow/Keras,
* A video tutorial on using deep autoencoders for anomaly detection in network traffic,
* A written tutorial on using LSTM autoencoders to detect anomalies in time-series data.

### The assessed component of this module is:

A project on using LSTM encoders to train an intrusion detection system based on the KDD99 dataset

### By the end of this module you will:

* Have a working understanding of generative models and deep learning techniques for generative modeling, i.e., variational autoencodersand GANs
* Gain hands-on knowledge of how to implement GANs in Keras
* Know how autoencoders can be used for anomaly detection
* Gain hands-on knowledge of using LSTM autoencoders for anomaly detection in time-series data
